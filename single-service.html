                        Whether you are moving into a new home, or updating the
                        grounds of the home you already live in, landscaping can
                        dramatically change the look of your house and property.
                        You may like a neatly trimmed lawn or prefer a wild and
                        overgrown look, you may live in an arid climate and need
                        to xeriscape, or you may like finely manicured
                        rosebushes.The cost of landscaping varies greatly but
                        most homeowners report spend- ing between
                        <span>$1,586 and $5,017.</span> Before you call the
                        pros, though, here are a few things to think about that
                        will affect your individual land- scaping project's cost
                        that may have you spending more or less than the
                        average.
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-lg-5 col-md-6 col-sm-6 bottom_text_left">
                      <h5>How large is your <span>property?</span></h5>
                      <p>
                        The single largest factor in the cost of your new
                        landscaping installation is the size of your property.
                        If your house sits on a huge lot, and you're not sure if
                        you can afford to landscape the entire area, talk to
                        your professional landscaper about the possibility of
                        landscaping it in sections. Xeriscaping is a style of
                        landscaping that utilizes plants, shrubs, ground covers
                        and rocks that need very little water to thrive. The
                        cost of installing a xeriscaped yard is often more than
                        simply planting grass and flowers. However, once
                        established the maintenance and water costs are kept low
                        by design. A professional landscaper and gardener will
                        be able to tell you the best approach for this. For
                        example, if there are plants that take a longer time to
                        come to maturity you may be able to plant them first and
                        when they are reaching their peak landscape
                      </p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="col-lg-7 col-md-6 col-sm-6 bottom_text_right">
                      <h5>Do you want a <span>Design?</span></h5>
                      <p>
                        Lawns are not expensive to plant. Enough grass seed to
                        cover your property is far less expensive than exotic
                        plants or other features. however, lawns need careful
                        maintenance, and plenty of water, especially at the
                        beginning to get them established. So you may feel a
                        lawn is a simple and affordable way to go, but it may
                        take more money in the long run in terms of water, time
                        and labor
                      </p>

                      <p>
                        Don't spend time and money on beautiful landscaping if
                        you have not taken water and irrigation issues into
                        account first. Installing a sprinkler system, leveling
                        the ground to avoid run off, and planning which plants,
                        shrubs or flowers will get more and less water are all
                        precautions that may take more time and money in the
                        short term but will benefit you in the long run. You
                        want to give your lawns and gardens the best chance to
                        thrive

                        grounds of the home you already live in, landscaping can
                        dramatically change the look of your house and property.
                        You may like a neatly trimmed lawn or prefer a wild and
                        overgrown look, you may live in an arid climate and need
                        to xeriscape, or you may like finely manicured
                        rosebushes.The cost of landscaping varies greatly but
                        most homeowners report spend- ing between

                        will affect your individual land- scaping project's cost
                        that may have you spending more or less than the
                        average.

                        The single largest factor in the cost of your new
                        landscaping installation is the size of your property.
                        If your house sits on a huge lot, and you're not sure if
                        you can afford to landscape the entire area, talk to
                        your professional landscaper about the possibility of
                        landscaping it in sections. Xeriscaping is a style of
                        landscaping that utilizes plants, shrubs, ground covers
                        and rocks that need very little water to thrive. The
                        cost of installing a xeriscaped yard is often more than
                        simply planting grass and flowers. However, once
                        established the maintenance and water costs are kept low
                        by design. A professional landscaper and gardener will
                        be able to tell you the best approach for this. For
                        example, if there are plants that take a longer time to
                        come to maturity you may be able to plant them first and
                        when they are reaching their peak landscape

                        The single largest factor in the cost of your new

                        If your house sits on a huge lot, and you're not sure if
                        you can afford to landscape the entire area, talk to
                        your professional landscaper about the possibility of
                        landscaping it in sections. Xeriscaping is a style of
                        landscaping that utilizes plants, shrubs, ground covers
                        and rocks that need very little water to thrive. The
                        cost of installing a xeriscaped yard is often more than
                        simply planting grass and flowers. However, once
                        established the maintenance and water costs are kept low
                        by design. A professional landscaper and gardener will
                        be able to tell you the best approach for this. For
                        example, if there are plants that take a longer time to
                        come to maturity you may be able to plant them first and

                        Lawns are not expensive to plant. Enough grass seed to

                          Patios or decks are a great addition to your
                          landscaping plan as they provide a relaxing place for
                          you to enjoy your new lawn and garden, as well as a
                          great place to entertain friends. The overall cost
                          will depend on the materials you choose. For example,
                          Cement block or brick patios may be more affordable
